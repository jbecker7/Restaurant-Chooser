# Restaurant Chooser

In this project, I am attempting to create a simple Python function similar to the "slot machine" function that the Urbanspoon had prior to being acquired by Zomato.

# Simple Chooser

To begin, I created the simple_chooser function, which allows to user to choose one of four options: randomize, type, cost, or meal. From there, the function either randomly selects a restaurant from a pre-defined list of restaurants in Claremont, CA or allows the user to narrow by one of the other categories (e.g. breakfast places) before randomly selecting a restaurant within that group.

# Advanced Chooser

Building upon the simple_chooser function, I made an advanced_chooser function that allows users to lock more than one option (e.g. find an American place open for breakfast). To achieve this, I created an option called "anything works" that users can select if they don't want to lock that category. Aside from that, the core of the function is very similar to the simple_chooser function. 

# Advanced Chooser with Simple GUI

Now I want to add a simple GUI
